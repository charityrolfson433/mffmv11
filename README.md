## Bengali Fonts
 - Create a folder named MFFM in your local storage. The folder should be automatically created if you flash for the first time.
 - You are gonna need 3 styles/weights of your Bengali font, Bold/Medium/Regular. If you have only one weight (ie. Regular), copy it and make total 3 copies.
 - Rename the 3 weight (Bold/Medium/Regular) Bengali font like this:
  
       Bengali-Regular.ttf  
       Bengali-Medium.ttf  
       Bengali-Bold.ttf
   
 - From this point you can directly copy the font files to `MFFM Folder (/LocalStorage/MFFM)` or make a zip of the fonts and rename it to `Bengali.zip` and then copy it to avoid messy environment inside the folder.
