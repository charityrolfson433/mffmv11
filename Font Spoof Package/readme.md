# Basic instructions::
- Make sure your system is RW (rewritable), cause you can't modify / flash anything to system with RO partitions. Which indicates: Avoid EROFS Roms, if you care too much about using custom font and also don't want a broken safetynet. 
- In Twrp mount `system` `product` `data` partition before flashing.
- Uncheck `unmount system before flashing` during the flashing in TWRP's flashing screen.
